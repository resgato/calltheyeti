Yeti Plumbing website built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

## Getting Started

First, set the public site URL (for correct canonical URLs and JSON-LD), then run the dev server:

```bash
export NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL="http://localhost:3000"
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) and ships structured data and SEO-friendly metadata.
